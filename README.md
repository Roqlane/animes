# animes

Personnal project about the animes that I watched. This website is composed of "cards" that represent each a watched anime.

On the front of the card you can see a quick description of the anime (studios, genres, number of episodes) and on the back its synopsys (made by chatGPT).

The final goal of this site would be to create a backend project, where users, after creating an account, could make their own list of cards with images and content of their choice.
